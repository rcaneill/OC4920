abstract = "Daily hydrographic measurements between 1954 and 1986, monthly environmental monitoring data from the last decades, and high-resolution data from 2001 are combined to obtain statistics on the exchange of the water above sill level in Gullmar Fjord, Sweden. The analyses show: (i) that the average turnover time is 16–26 days for the water above the halocline (S<28), and 40 days for the intermediate water below the halocline, (ii) that the exchange is dominated by baroclinic currents caused by vertical fluctuations of the halocline outside the fjord, and (iii) that the statistics for the turnover times are relatively independent of year and season. One implication of these results is that a coupling between climate variations and water quality in Gullmar Fjord, cannot be explained in terms of variations in the water exchange."

abstract = "A time series of geostrophic winds from 1892 until present is used to force a simple upwelling model. The model is tuned against a long time series (1930–1989) of daily hydrographic observations at Bornö station inside Gullmar fjord at the Swedish west coast. It is shown that a large part of the short-term variability at Bornö is controlled by upwelling events that can be predicted from the model. Statistical properties of upwelling events for the entire forcing period are presented as well as time series of upwelling and downwelling. Distinctive feature of the upwelling in the time series are: a declining trend between the late 1890s and 1920, an increasing trend between 1920 and 1940s and another declining trend between 1950s and 1990. After 1990 no trend is obvious. Another feature is that upwelling during summer (May–September) is much less intense after 1963. The up/downwelling is related in a qualitative way to the North Atlantic oscillation index during January–April but there is no correlation during summer. Some possible effects on the coastal marine environment due to long-term changes of the upwelling intensity are discussed."

abstract = {Temperature and salinity both contribute to ocean density, including its seasonal cycle and spatial patterns in the mixed layer. Temperature and salinity profiles from the Argo Program allow construction and analysis of a global, monthly, mixed layer climatology. Temperature changes dominate the seasonal cycle of mixed layer density in most regions, but salinity changes are dominant in the tropical warm pools, Arctic, and Antarctic. Under the Intertropical Convergence Zone, temperature and salinity work in concert to increase seasonal stratification, but the seasonal density changes there are weak because the temperature and salinity changes are small. In the eastern subtropics, seasonal salinity changes partly compensate those in temperature and reduce seasonal mixed layer density changes. Besides a hemispheric seasonal reversal, the times of maximum and minimum mixed layer density exhibit regional variations. For instance, the equatorial region is more closely aligned with Southern Hemisphere timing, and much of the North Indian Ocean has a minimum density in May and June. Outside of the tropics, the maximum mixed layer density occurs later in the winter toward the poles, and the minimum earlier in the summer. Finally, at the times of maximum mixed layer density, some of the ocean has horizontal temperature and salinity gradients that work against each other to reduce the horizontal density gradient. However, on the equatorial sides of the subtropical salinity maxima, temperature and salinity gradients reinforce each other, increasing the density gradients there. Density gradients are generally stronger where either salinity or temperature gradients are dominant influences.},,
