\section{\label{sec_intro}Introduction}

TODO find references about fjords, skagerrak


Two typical water masses are present along the western coast of Sweden
\citep{bjork2003,gustafsson1996}.
One water masse is composed by fresh water coming from the Batic sea through the Kattegat.
Its salinity is situated between 15/20 and 25.
The second one comes from Atlantic water and is largely present in the Skagerrak
and has a salinity of about 33 at the surface and 35 at 100 meters depth.

The water in the Gullman fjord is mainly composed of these
Kattegat and Skagerrak waters \citep{arneborg2003}, limit of
salinity 28 between them.

\section{Materials and methods}
\subsection{Presentation of the field work and data acquisition}

TODO bad weather: from high sea to fjord

This report focuses on a field work that has been conducted on December 2018, the
10th and 11th, as part of the course OC4920 of the University of Gothenburg.
Two days have been spent on two ships, the Skagerrak and the Trygve.
Both ships had fully equipped CTD, with temperature, salinity, and oxygen concentration
sensors. Some other variables have been recorded but not discussed on this
report. Niskins bottle have been used for the oxygen calibration on board of
the Skagerrak.

We got more than 50 casts, covering the fjord with a very good spatial coverage.
We also made 3 mooring measurements, setting the CTD at a certain depth
for 30 minutes, recording the temporal variations instead of the
spatial variations.
Figure~\ref{fig:stations} presents the position of the Gullman Fjord, on the western
coast of Sweden, as well as the position of the CTD casts.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{stations}
  \caption{\label{fig:stations}Situation of the Gullman Fjord (red dot) and position
    of the CTD casts (green dots).}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data processing}
For a better readability, we will refer to potential temperature as temperature
and to absolute salinity as salinity.
If needed, we will explicitly use the term {\it in situ} to refer to
measured temperature and salinity.

To ensure coherence in the whole dataset and between the two ships,
all the data have been regridded on a 1 meter grid, from 0 to 119 meters depth.
Depths without any measurement points have been filled with NaN.

\paragraph{Processing}
Using the library provided by TEOS-10 \citep{gsw}, {\it in situ} temperatures and practical
salinities have been converted to potential temperature and absolute salinity.
Potential density anomaly has also been derived.

\paragraph{Calibration}
One cast has been conducted at the same position with the two ships each day,
so that all the measured variables can be calibrated between the two datasets.
The Skagerrak data have been chosen as reference data, because of a more
recent recalibration of the CTD sensors than the Trygve sensors.
After a linear regression between Trygve and Skagerrak calibration profiles
under the thermocline, the coefficients have been used to recalibrate
Trygve profiles for each day.
See Table~\ref{tab:calib} for the used coefficients.


\subsection{Turner angle}
One way to estimate the role of the salinity and the temperature on the stratification
is to use the Turner angle $Tu$ \citep{ruddick1983, johnson2012}:
\[Tu = atan2(\alpha \partial_z T + \beta \partial_z S,
\alpha \partial_z T - \beta \partial_z S),\]
with $\alpha$ the thermal expansion, $\beta$ the haline contraction,
$\partial_z T$ the vertical gradient of the temperature,
$\partial_z S$ the vertical gradient of the salinity,
and $atan2$ the four-quadrants inverse tangent.
If $Tu = 45\degree$ the temperature controls totaly the density changes,
if $Tu = -45\degree$ the salinity controls totaly the density changes,
at $0 \degree$ the temperature and the salinity control both equally
the density changes.
If $|Tu| > 45\degree$ the temperature and the salinity are working
one against the other, with total compensation if $|Tu| = 90$.

The Turner angle has been computed at every depth for each profile,
using values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ given by the TEOS-10 library.


%\subsection{Geostrophy TODO compute}
\subsection{Profile fitting and layers}
Temperature profiles in the fjord all look very similar, with
\begin{inparaenum}
\item an upper thermocline;
\item a warm water mass;
\item a lower thermocline;
\item the lowest layer where temperature is approximately constant.
\end{inparaenum}
It is not easy to compute the depth of these layer by using a threshold (on the
value or on the gradient) due to the irregularities of the temperature.
Inspired by the work of \cite{pauthenet2017}, we decided to approximate
the profiles with a function and then extract the layers information from the
functions properties. As the studied profiles have all the same shapes,
we used a mutli-linear fit, fitting the 4 layers.
The parameters of the fitted function are the depths and the temperatures
of the interface between each layers. We considered that for the lowest layer,
the fitted temperature will be a constant. An {\it a priori} model was set
for these 8 parameters, with values set by eye to be a good candidate.
Table~\ref{tab:apriori} in Appendix presents the parameters. The least squares
approximation has been used to find the best parameters.
For the profiles that are not deep enough, only the part where data are present
has been used for the least squares method. The {\it a priori} model
has been set for the lower part, with a confidence flag set to 0.
Figure~\ref{fig:fit} presents two examples of profiles: one where the 4 layers
are present and one where the fjord was not deep enough, so only
the upper layer is fitted.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{{explainProfFit}}
  \caption{\label{fig:fit}Profile fitting with a multi-linear function.
    The measured profiles are plotted in green, the fitted functions in blue,
    and the red crosses represent depth and temperature at the interfaces
    between the different layers. On the right plot, the fit corresponds to the
    {\it a priori} model for the two lowest interfaces.}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}
%\paragraph{T and S profiles}

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{prof_fjord}
  \caption{\label{fig:profex}Example of two profiles, offshore on the top and in
    the Gullman fjord on the bottom.
    These profiles are very representative of all the measured profiles.
    The emperature is in blue, the salinity is in red and the density anomaly
  is in green.}
  
\end{figure}
The offshore transect and the casts inside the fjord have different shapes
(Figure~\ref{fig:profex}).
A mixed layer of few meters is present offshore.
The salinity is around 29 at the surface of the offshore profile, increasing
along a sharp halocline to more than 34. The salinity is here representative
of Skagerrak water.
The temperature follows the same kind of shape: roughly constant
in the mixed layer and then increasing.
The density is increasing under the mixed layer, even if the temperature
increases, it is not sufficient to compensate the large variation
of the salinity, leading to a density controlled by the salinity here.

On the opposite, in the very calm
conditions of the fjord, no mixed layer is visible.
An upper layer of 10 to 20 meters controlled by a strong halocline
lies over a warm water mass, where density seems to follow the shape of
the salinity. The salinity changes a little bit in this warm water and in the lower layers,
but keeps values over 34 when the temperature variates from 10 $\degree$C
to 9.5 $\degree$C at the bottom of the warm water to reach a little
more than 6.5 $\degree$ at the bottom.
Despite a slight decrease of the salinity after 60 meters, the density
seems to be controlled by the temperature variations of the lower thermocline.

%\paragraph{T-S diagram}
The 28 salinity limit in the fjord profiles is in the middle
of the upper cline. \cite{arneborg2003} present an upper layer (around 10 meter
depth) of Kattegat water in the fjord during the summer, under which a halocline
and the Skagerrak water are present. The depth of the halocline is strongly related
to the inflow or outflow of water in the fjord.
Even if the Kattegat water seems to be present at the surface (Figure~\ref{fig:ts}),
the main part of the water is Skagerrak water. The upper cline
is visible on Figure~\ref{fig:ts}, as the mixing between the Kattegat (yellow points)
and the Skagerrak upper water (yellow/green points).
The salinity and the temperature of the bottom stagnant layer
have very little spatial variation.
