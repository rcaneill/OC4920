\section{\label{sec_intro}Introduction}

TODO find references about fjords, skagerrak

\section{Materials and methods}
\subsection{Presentation of the field work and data acquisition}

This report focuses on a field work that has been conducted on December 2018, the
10th and 11th, as part of the course OC4920 of the University of Gothenburg.
Two days have been spent on two ships, the Skagerrak and the Trygve.
Both ships had fully equipped CTD, with temperature, salinity, and oxygen concentration
sensors. Some other variables have been recorded but not discussed on this
report. Niskins bottle have been used for the oxygen calibration on board of
the Skagerrak.

We got more than 50 casts, covering the fjord with a very good spatial coverage.
We also made 3 mooring measurements, setting the CTD at a certain depth
for 30 minutes, recording the temporal variations instead of the
spatial variations.
Figure~\ref{fig:stations} presents the position of the Gullman Fjord, on the western
coast of Sweden, as well as the position of the CTD casts.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{stations}
  \caption{\label{fig:stations}Situation of the Gullman Fjord (red dot) and position
    of the CTD casts (green dots).}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data processing}
For a better readability, we will refer to potential temperature as temperature
and to absolute salinity as salinity.
If needed, we will explicitly use the term {\it in situ} to refer to
measured temperature and salinity.

To ensure coherence in the whole dataset and between the two ships,
all the data have been regridded on a 1 meter grid, from 0 to 119 meters depth.
Depths without any measurement points have been filled with NaN.

\paragraph{Processing}
Using the library provided by TEOS-10 \citep{gsw}, {\it in situ} temperatures and practical
salinities have been converted to potential temperature and absolute salinity.
Potential density anomaly has also been derived.

\paragraph{Calibration}
One cast has been conducted at the same position with the two ships each day,
so that all the measured variables can be calibrated between the two datasets.
The Skagerrak data have been chosen as reference data, because of a more
recent recalibration of the CTD sensors than the Trygve sensors.
After a linear regression between Trygve and Skagerrak calibration profiles
under the thermocline, the coefficients have been used to recalibrate
Trygve profiles for each day.
See Table~\ref{tab:calib} for the used coefficients.


\subsection{Turner angle}
One way to estimate the role of the salinity and the temperature on the stratification
is to use the Turner angle.
\citep{ruddick1983, johnson2012}

\subsection{Geostrophy TODO compute}
\subsection{Profile fitting and layers}
Temperature profiles in the fjord all look very similar, with
\begin{inparaenum}
\item an upper thermocline;
\item a warm water mass;
\item a lower thermocline;
\item the lowest layer where temperature is approximately constant.
\end{inparaenum}
It is not easy to compute the depth of these layer by using a threshold (on the
value or on the gradient) due to the irregularities of the temperature.
Inspired by the work of \cite{pauthenet2017}, we decided to approximate
the profiles with a function and then extract the layers information from the
functions properties. As the studied profiles have all the same shapes,
we used a mutli-linear fit, fitting the 4 layers.
The parameters of the fitted function are the depths and the temperatures
of the interface between each layers. We considered that for the lowest layer,
the fitted temperature will be a constant. An {\it a priori} model was set
for these 8 parameters, with values set by eye to be a good candidate.
Table~\ref{tab:apriori} in Appendix presents the parameters. The least squares
approximation has been used to find the best parameters.
For the profiles that are not deep enough, only the part where data are present
has been used for the least squares method. The {\it a priori} model
has been set for the lower part, with a confidence flag set to 0.
Figure~\ref{fig:fit} presents two examples of profiles: one where the 4 layers
are present and one where the fjord was not deep enough, so only
the upper layer is fitted.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{{explainProfFit}}
  \caption{\label{fig:fit}Profile fitting with a multi-linear function.
    The measured profiles are plotted in green, the fitted functions in blue,
    and the red crosses represent depth and temperature at the interfaces
    between the different layers. On the right plot, the fit corresponds to the
    {\it a priori} model for the two lowest interfaces.}

\section{Results}

\paragraph{T-S diagram}
see figure \ref{fig:ts}

we recognize Skagerrak and Kattegat water \citep{bjork2003,gustafsson1996}

Kattegat salinity 15/20(depending on the source)-25

Skagerrak salinity between 33 (surface) to 35 (100m depth)
