### Evening 11 december
* I added the coordinates to the .nc files for TB (day1)
* I bin averaged ctd profile for station 5 (that was very looooooong)

## Planned to do
* I will regrid all data along the same depth (120m should be OK to be sure with all measurments). Filling
  gaps with NaNs
* I will focus on depth of the different layers

## Idea
I just thought for the surface temperature: for the offshore cast, even if with only have temperature at 4m, the thermocline has a smaller gradient than the thermocline in the fjord => temperature at 4m is not so far from temperature at 1m

See if there is a small mixed layer offshore => temeprature at 4m is ~ than temp at surface
