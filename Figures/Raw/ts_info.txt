###Some info about the TS diagram

Gullmar Fjord is separated into two different water types:

A: water with salinities ranging 24-27
B: water with salinities ranging 32-33

These water types correspond with the typical water masses found outside the fjord: 

Kattegat: Salinities range 20-25
Skagerak: Surface salinities 33-35 (with depth)

Natural separation between the two water types is the 28 isohaline
